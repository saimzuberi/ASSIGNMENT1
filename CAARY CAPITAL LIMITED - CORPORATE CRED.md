# CAARY CAPITAL LIMITED - CORPORATE CREDIT SIMPLIFIED 

## Overview and Origin

* The Company CAARY CAPITAL was created in Oct 2020 out of the Covid Financial Crisis when a number of businesses were unable to access credit and support the business activities during the pandemic. The Founders Steve Steve Apostolopoulos is a managing partner in Triple Group of Companies (TGC) and the Co-Founder and Chief Development Officer of Triple Properties which has a substantial commercial real estate business while Jason Sawyer is a veteran of the alternative investment business and currently General Manager of Access Alternative Group S.A., a Nassau, Bahamas based venture investment and advisory firm.

In the early days company was primarly funded by Friends and Family and initailly raised just about $ 1.7 Million as a Pre-Seed round and used public funding using platform Frontfundr to raise additional $ 4 Million for complete platform development. 

The need for CAARY as stated in an interview by Jason in an interview was that he was in a mining venture and had to bank roll the project on his personal cerdit cards as no bank was willing to give credit to a start up venture and to break that cycle he wanted to create capability to support businesses like his. 


## Business Activities:

CAARY is a payments and credit platform targeting Canadian small and medium-sized businesses (“SMEs”). CAARY is partnered with Mastercard and delivers an innovative suite of fintech features for card management, expense reporting, and money transfers; developed under the leadership of former senior bankers, technologists, consultants and software professionals.

The company is geared up towards solving the credit problems for the SME industry and the access to credit is difficult and simplfying the credit to businesses is the sole purpose of the organization. 

The company is trageting SME businesses in Canada and there are roughly 1.3 Million SMEs in Canada which rely on traditional banks which offer limited credit facilities and those are also against personal gurantees. 

Caary Capital offers no personal gurantee credit with objective of adjudication in less than 30 mins (they have not reached this target) with special discount pricing of 1.5% cash back along with personalized employee cards and spend management solutions. 

This is a green field as compared to traditioanl FIs which are not really focused on SME sector and agility is the unfair advantage for CAARY, what CAARY can deliver in a Quarter, traditional FIs would take years. 

CAARY has a uniquely set up architecture and working as a system integrator of various solutions which comprises of solutions like 
a. Banking in Box providers, 
b. Open Banking partners, 
c. Accounting Aggregation Firms 
d. Receipt Management solution providers 

to build a state of the art platform which allows them to issue credit and capability of manageing the same through smart platform. 

The technology stack for Caary Capital is diversified with a mix of 
- .Net 
- .Net Core 
- React  
- React Native 
- Php 
- Woo Commerce 
- HubSpot
- WordPress
- SQL
- Elastic Stack etc. 

While they are currently complete Cloud Native is Azure being the primary choice of Infrastrucure provider. 

## Landscape:

There are a number of challengers for SME lending to traditional banks in the US with the likes of BREX, RAMP, DIVI raising hundreds of million dollars for lending to the SMEs and enhancement of technology.  

These challengers are giving excellent customer services “white glove services” to the customers and allowing them to move faster and be smarter about the financial cashflow management. 

In the Canadian landscape, there is Jeeves and Float which are a direct competition to CAARY and they are competing based on rewards and service quality in the Canadian market.  

## Results
The company has seen its monthly tractions volumes double very month since the last fall pilot launch and will continue to expand as more and more customer are onboarded. 

The success to any credit portfolio is specially in the un-collateralized portfolio space is the loss rates and if they can maintain with 1 ~ 2% they will be deemed a amazing credit portfolio. 

The second criteria for success is the total spend on the card, the projected the average business spend on the card is $ 30K per annum and the ideal and CAARY is targeting $ 100K+ per annum. 

The third criteria for success is number of active cards on file and caary has bee increasing cards on file in a hockey stick fashion.  

## Recommendations

If I were to advice the company, I would recommend development of an AI based Algo which will allow them to adjudicate based on cashflow statements, investments and frequency of payments from customers to device a plan for credit limit allocations. 

This will replace the manual process deciding the credit limits of the clients after review of the financial account and bank statements. 

This will require Python to be added to the technology stack for the purpose of development of the AI and data management model.
